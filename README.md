# Time to use a Grownup CMS:
## Why should it be Drupal?
Submitted by: Ian Carrico, Web Chef at Four Kitchens

Building a responsive site, a new social media site, or even a new site for your startup, all websites must first look at the framework to build their site upon. There are many options available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, but Drupal stands out in the open-source community as a CMS with the largest ability to conform to most projects. Its community constantly drives new innovation and development for features, making it more useful by the day. 

Drupal's core system is simple enough to be understood by a new developer after some short training, but extendibility made it the choice for sites from The Economist to The White House. This session will show the tools available to use Drupal as a robust, responsive, powerful content authoring platform, and use-cases on responsive sites and web-apps built with Drupal. It is for not only developers who are interested in what Drupal can bring their team, but also startups who are looking to build a new site.
